  "title.mystictome.intro.page.2.text": "The reverberations previously mentioned are in a sense, cosmic whiplash on a universal scale. As the singularity expanded, every particle was thrown around in every which way. While at first, this was cause for chaos, the wheels of time have marched on and calmed things down as they do rendering the vibrations very minute, but minute is not zero. Minute for one atom can be magnified exponentially when concentrated enough, resonating with one another allowing for the force of the big bang to be felt once more.",
  "title.mystictome.intro.page.3.text": "One of the quirks of the antimatter/matter duality is that the vibrations of these particles are opposite and equal as well. These vibrations follow the same principle that all other forms of vibration be it sound/light/electricity etc, in that they amplify when met with similar waves and cancel when met with opposing waves. Building on the concentration effect of these vibrations, the idea of karma can even be traced back as the balance of these vibrations within your body, and mana is just the net force of the anti and positive waves manifesting as a physical and invisible force.",
  "title.mystictome.intro.page.4.text": "Matter and antimatter can become \"vibratory\" in some rare examples simply by happenstance when enough of a single frequency of resonating matter comes into close proximity and will somewhat meld together. When they coalesce they are called \"drops\" or \"tears\" for vibrations and antivibration respectively with \"essence\" being the overarching term for both forms of concentrated vibrational matter. Essence can be found in all forms of life with a very low concentration but can be coerced out of them upon death with specialized tools discussed later.",
  "title.mystictome.intro.page.5.text": "The process of inducing vibrations is known as \"Channeling\", mystical sounding in nature, but the elders can be blamed for this. This can be done in a variety of ways all modeled off of trying to artificially induce the natural essence production, by essentially taking a chunk of vibratory or \"conductive\" matter and allowing it to collect more and more matter that begins to resonate with it, which is an exponential process. The beauty of this process is that once an original drop or tear of matter is created, it will naturally start to produce more of itself with little aide.If only there was a way to contain this growth...",
  "title.mystictome.intro.page.6.text": "As mentioned prior, these vibrations behave the same way that any other wave does, and as such can be stopped or dampened with an opposite waveform. Producing this waveform can be tricky but with a little bit of experimenting, discovering that the more your around concentrated matter, the more sensitive you become to it, beginning to be able to sense slight differences in direction and amplitude each drop. By using matter of specific frequency you can change the characteristics of other matter by forcing contact with the target. The process of canceling vibrations intentionally is called \"Nullification\" and is incredibly useful.",
  "title.mystictome.intro.page.7.text": "Due to the nature of life itself, being inherently organized, living beings are naturally enriched with essence, almost completely filled with positive vibrations in fact. This is not to say that ALL creatures are positive, there are some exceptions that have net negative vibrations(withers and end creatures), and some that have none at all(skeletons and other inorganic life)! Because of this, the essence can be farmed quite readily through the process of death, with the correct tools, of course, ones that nullified vibrations maybe?",
  "title.mystictome.runes.page.1.text": "One of the more obscure and well...macabre ways that vibrations can be channeled is through the use of special designs carved into slates called \"runes\", the carvings in these runes are unique and as such provide unique effects based on the direction, amount, and frequencies of vibrations they channel these. These runes are normally carried just on your person but they carry a bit deeper of an effect.",
  "title.mystictome.runes.page.2.text": "These mind runes hide a bit darker side than just being a simple good luck charm however, they have physical and metaphysical sides. The channels in the stone are actually mirrored on the brain of the carrier, unlocking the effects inside of the person, not just applying them.

The scary part is that, even though you are not aware of it, even your own consciousness is influenced by these tiny events, affecting what you do and how you behave depending on where you may be. Many mental ailments in fact can be chalked up to vibrational imbalances.",
  "title.mystictome.world.page.2.text": "The plants around us have very little way of communicating with us, so they can\u2019t necessarily tell us what the vibrations do to influence them, but do to the research of scholars prior we have realized by forcing vibrations of all kinds into plants what effect they have on them. While they did exist prior albeit very solemnly, there is a type of tree that is especially good at vibrationally channeling and as such have even turned blue! Their existence now however has been spread even farther as a result of an experiment run loose and allowing a genetically altered species of this tree to appear even more commonly, albeit quite skinnier.",
  "title.mystictome.world.page.3.text": "The mind sure is a magical place in its own right, but it is normally locked away inside of that skull of yours. When you dream the barrier between reality and imagination starts to dissolve, allowing for a glimpse into a world completely of your own subconscious.
